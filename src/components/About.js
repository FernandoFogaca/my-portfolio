      <p>
        Hello! I’m Fernando, a Systems Analysis student transitioning into
        front-end development with ambitions of becoming a Full-Stack
        Developer. I’ve completed coursework in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript I & II,
        and React fundamentals, alongside an introduction to back-end basics.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, I’m honing my practical skills with React components,
        CSS Grid & Flexbox, and deploying projects on Netlify. I’m also
        exploring CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and cloud hosting on Firebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although still early in my journey, I’m eager to bring my energy,
        curiosity and strong willingness to learn to a 32 h/week internship
        and contribute to real-world projects.
      </p>
